# Actor ABI


## Memory

Memory is managed in cache-line-aligned blocks of 32 bytes (8x32-bit words).
An event-block holds a message and the target actor
to whom it will be dispatched.
An actor-block holds actor behavior and state.
Blocks may be chained
in order to extend the available storage
as needed.


## Registers

On entry to an actor behavior,
we want as many registers available as we can get.
The kernel's event dispatch loop does not make any assumptions
about the contents of r0-r9.
Actor behaviors may use r4-r9 freely, without preserving them.
Actor behaviors may also use r0-r3,
although they should not expect them to survive a kernel call.
Kernel procedures called from actor behaviors
are required to preserve r4-r9, but may freely use r0-r3.
Consistent special meanings are given to r10-r15.

| Register | Kernel Usage    | Actor Usage     |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| r0       | arg_0 / result  | block address   |
| r1       | arg_1 / tmp_1   | target / answer |
| r2       | arg_2 / tmp_2   | base address    |
| r3       | arg_3 / tmp_3   | working data    |
| r4       | --preserved--   | state_0         |
| r5       | --preserved--   | state_1         |
| r6       | --preserved--   | state_2         |
| r7       | --preserved--   | state_3         |
| r8       | --preserved--   | --available--   |
| r9       | --preserved--   | --available--   |
| r10 (sl) | sponsor link    | sponsor link    |
| r11 (fp) | event frame ptr | event frame ptr |
| r12 (ip) | actor index ptr | actor index ptr |
| r13 (sp) | stack pointer   | stack pointer   |
| r14 (lr) | link register   | link register   |
| r15 (pc) | program counter | program counter |

All computation is driven by dispatching events.
An event designates a target actor and
up 7 words of additional message content.
When the target actor's behavior begins executing,
r10 (sl) will indicate the sponsor of the computation,
r11 (fp) will point to the base of the event block, and
r12 (ip) will point to the base of the actor block.
Kernel procedures called from an actor behavior
will expect r10 (sl) to remain stable,
pointing to the sponsor.
Note that actors should consider the sponsor opaque.


## Event Structure

An event block begins with the address of the actor
to whom the event will be dispatched.
The rest of the block may contain 0 to 7 additional words of message data.
~~~
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
  0x00  | address of target actor       |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x04  | customer / ok                 |  m
        + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +  e
  0x08  | parameter / fail              |  s
        + . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +  s
  0x0c  |                               |  a
        +       .       .       .       +  g
  0x10  |                               |  e
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x14  |                               |  d
        +       .       .       .       +  a
  0x18  |                               |  t
        +       .       .       .       +  a
  0x1c  |                               |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
~~~
By convention, the first word of the message (at offset 0x04)
is often the customer (an actor) to whom a reply may be directed.
The second word of the message (at offset 0x08) is usually the first parameter.
In the case that an actor may report success or failure,
two customers are provided.
The ok customer (at offset 0x04) for success/true results,
and the fail customer (at offet 0x08) for failure/false results.
Additional parameters may follow starting at offset 0x0c.


## Actor Structure

The target actor may be accessed through the event block (offset 0x00),
or more directly via register r12 (ip).
An actor block must begin with directly executable code.
The block may also contain data fields
accessed by the code of the behavior.

### Example 0

There are several reasonable strategies
for organizing an actor's behavior.
The most basic is to embed the behavior
directly in the actor block.
Example 0 illustrates the typical elements
of a directly-coded actor behavior.
~~~
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
  0x00  |       bl      reserve         |  m
        +-------------------------------+  a
  0x04  |       ldr     r1, [ip, #0x1c] |  c
        +-------------------------------+  h
  0x08  |       str     r1, [r0, #0x04] |  i  (_a_answer: r0=event, r1=answer)
        +-------------------------------+  n
  0x0c  |       ldr     r1, [fp, #0x04] |  e  (_a_reply: r0=event)
        +-------------------------------+
  0x10  |       str     r1, [r0]        |  c  (_a_send: r0=event, r1=target)
        +-------------------------------+  o
  0x14  |       bl      enqueue         |  d  (_a_end: r0=event)
        +-------------------------------+  e
  0x18  |       b       complete        |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x1c  | data field containing answer  |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
~~~
This actor behavior begins by calling `reserve`
to allocate a new block for a reply-message event.
The kernel procedure `reserve` is allowed to change r0-r3,
but must preserve r4-r9, and returns the block address in r0.
Next, r1 is loaded from the actor block offset 0x1c (the answer).
The answer in r1 is stored in the reply-event block at offset 0x04.
Now, r1 is reloaded with the customer
from the request-event block offset 0x04.
The customer in r1 is stored as the target
of the reply-message event.
The reply-message event is added to the event queue
by calling the `enqueue` kernel procedure (which may change r0-r3).
Finally, the actor behavior jumps to `complete`,
which ends the processing of the request-event
and dispatches the next event.

Many directly-coded actor behaviors end with similar steps.
These steps have been extracted into a series of jump labels
that can be used to complete an actor behavior.
They can be considered abbreviations
for common sequences of completion steps.
Working backwards, we will consider the circumstances
in with each jump label is useful.

All actor behaviors must end with a jump to `complete`.
If they also want to `enqueue` an event,
they can jump to `_a_end` instead,
with the new event in r0.

If the target for the new event is in r1,
the actor can jump to `_a_send`,
which stores the target in the event
before calling `enqueue`.

If the target for the new event is
the customer from the current event,
the actor can jump to `_a_reply`,
which loads the target address
from the current event block (offset 0x04).

If the answer is in r1,
the target is the current-event customer,
and the new event is in r0,
the actor can jump to `_a_answer`,
which stores the answer in the new event (offset 0x04)
and performs all the previously described steps.

### Example 1

It is often useful for an actor's behavior
to be separated from it's state,
especially when the actor wants to switch
among several behaviors.
This can be accomplished by maintaining a pointer
to the desired behavior,
and jumping through that pointer to handle an event.
~~~
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
  0x00  |       ldr     pc, [pc, #-4]   |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x04  | address of actor behavior     |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x08  | actor state                   |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x0c  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x10  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x14  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x18  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x1c  |                               |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
~~~
As always, the kernel invokes an actor's behavior
by jumping to the beginning of the actor block.
The first instruction in the actor block
simply reloads the program counter
with the address of the current behavior.
Note that the value of pc is offset +8
from the currently executing instruction,
thus [pc, #-4] loads the new pc
from offset 0x04 in the actor block.
The actor behavior will have access to
the actor state
through the ip register,
which points to the beginning of the actor block.

### Example 2

Here is another way to implement an indirect call to the actor behavior.
~~~
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
  0x00  |       ldr     lr, [pc]        |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x04  |       blx     lr              |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x08  | address of actor behavior     |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x0c  | actor state                   |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x10  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x14  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x18  |                               |
        +       .       .       .       +
  0x1c  |                               |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
~~~
The first instruction loads the actor behavior address
(from offset 0x08 in the actor block)
into the link register.
The second instruction jumps to that address,
while setting the link register
to the address following the instruction,
which is the beginning of the actor's state
(and the pointer to the current behavior).

### Example 3

A more powerful indirect-behavior implementation
can pre-load a group of registers from the actor state
while jumping to the actual behavior code.
~~~
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
  0x00  |       mov     ip, pc          |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x04  |       ldmia   ip,{r4-r8,pc}   |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x08  | value for r4                  |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x0c  | value for r5                  |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x10  | value for r6                  |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x14  | value for r7                  |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x18  | value for r8                  |
        +-------------------------------+
  0x1c  | address of actor behavior     |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+
~~~
The first instruction loads the actor state address
(offset 0x08 into the actor block)
into the index pointer (ip).
The second instruction loads up to 6 registers,
including the program counter (pc),
from the actor block.
Loading the program counter causes a jump
to the address loaded,
which is the address of the actual behavior code.

The behavior then begins executing
with several actor-state fields
already loaded into convenient registers.
Any combination of registers may be loaded,
as long as the final register is the pc
(to jump to the behavior).
Note that the register values must be in numerical order
based on the register numbers to be loaded.
The actor behavior may use the pre-loaded state in registers,
but must write back to the actor block
(through ip, which is offset +0x08)
to update the persistent actor state.

## Actor/Behavior Library

### Built-In Actors

#### a_ignore

Ignore all messages.

| 0x18 | msg_6 |
| 0x1c | msg_7 |

Note: This actor is used in the implementation of `a_oneshot`.

#### a_oneshot

Forward first message to `delegate`,
then ignore all subsequent messages.

**WARNING**: _Do not use `a_oneshot` directly.
Clone it, then change the `delegate` in your copy._

| Offset | Actor Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | _code_ |
| 0x04 | _code_ |
| 0x08 | _code_ |
| 0x0c | _code_ |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | next behavior |
| 0x18 | current behavior |
| 0x1c | delegate = a_ignore |

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target = a_oneshot |
| 0x04 | msg_1 |
| 0x08 | msg_2 |
| 0x0c | msg_3 |
| 0x10 | msg_4 |
| 0x14 | msg_5 |
| 0x18 | msg_6 |
| 0x1c | msg_7 |

This actor uses the behavior of `a_forward`
to forward the first message it receives.
It then modifies the `current behavior` field
to ignore all subsequent messages.

#### a_fork

Initiate two concurrent service-events.

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target = a_fork |
| 0x04 | customer |
| 0x08 | event_0 |
| 0x0c | event_1 |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

This actor is a factory for a group of actors
that collaborate to execute overlapping events.
The `event_0` and `event_1` parameters are events,
prepared by not enqueued,
with appropriate targets and parameters.
The targets for `event_0` and `event_1` must be _services_.
This is, they must be actors which expect a single `customer`
as their first message parameter.
Note that the `customer` in each event will be overwritten
with a factory-generated proxy customer.
The results from both events will be combined into a single message
and sent to the original `customer`, like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target = customer |
| 0x04 | event_0 result 0x04 |
| 0x08 | event_1 result 0x04 |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

### Built-In Behaviors

#### b_label

Add `label` to message and forward to `delegate`.

| Offset | Actor Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | _code_ |
| 0x04 | _code_ |
| 0x08 | r4: delegate |
| 0x0c | r5: label |
| 0x10 | behavior = b_label |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | msg_1 |
| 0x08 | msg_2 |
| 0x0c | msg_3 |
| 0x10 | msg_4 |
| 0x14 | msg_5 |
| 0x18 | msg_6 |
| 0x1c | -- |

Note that the data at offset 0x1c in the inbound message
is not copied because we have to make room for the label.
After adding the label, the generated event looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | delegate |
| 0x04 | label |
| 0x08 | msg_1 |
| 0x0c | msg_2 |
| 0x10 | msg_3 |
| 0x14 | msg_4 |
| 0x18 | msg_5 |
| 0x1c | msg_6 |

#### b_tag

Label message with actor identity and forward to `delegate`.
Tag actors are often created as proxy customers
when we want to identify the source of a particular response.

| Offset | Actor Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | _code_ |
| 0x04 | _code_ |
| 0x08 | r4: delegate |
| 0x0c | behavior = b_tag |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | msg_1 |
| 0x08 | msg_2 |
| 0x0c | msg_3 |
| 0x10 | msg_4 |
| 0x14 | msg_5 |
| 0x18 | msg_6 |
| 0x1c | -- |

Note that the data at offset 0x1c in the inbound message
is dropped because we have to make room for the label.
This behavior modifies the inbound event,
adding it's own identity as a label,
and re-dispatches it without going through the event queue.
The modified event looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | delegate |
| 0x04 | target |
| 0x08 | msg_1 |
| 0x0c | msg_2 |
| 0x10 | msg_3 |
| 0x14 | msg_4 |
| 0x18 | msg_5 |
| 0x1c | msg_6 |

#### b_join

Combine results of concurrent computation.
Join actors are automatically generated by `a_fork`
to capture the results of concurrent event processing.
Results are expected to come through proxy customers with `b_tag` behavior,
so `b_join` can distinguish between the two results.

| Offset | Actor Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | _code_ |
| 0x04 | _code_ |
| 0x08 | r4: customer |
| 0x0c | r5: tag/result_0 |
| 0x10 | r6: tag/result_1 |
| 0x14 | behavior = b_join |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | tag |
| 0x08 | result |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

After both results have arrived,
a combined result event is generated:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | customer |
| 0x04 | result_0 |
| 0x08 | result_1 |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |


## Actor Capabilities

A typical view of object (and actors)
is that they have an "interface",
or vocabulary of message types they understand.
In practice,
this means that a message-event
must contain a "selector"
(usually a "name", but sometimes a "signature")
that identifies what kind of message it is.
The object/actor uses the selector
to (polymorphically) dispatch the message
to the proper implementation code.

Instead, we will consider each actor reference
to be a _capability_ that already knows what operation is expected.
An interface, then, consists of a collection of capabilities
that access and/or operate on some hidden shared state.
This is similar to the concept of "facets"
in some object-oriented systems.
It also provides fine-grained access control
by limiting the availability of certain capabilities.
The access-graph becomes the authority-graph.

In addition, we will generalize the idea of "return value"
(for services with a call-response protocol)
by introducing a pair of _customers_ called "ok" and "fail".
The _ok_ customer will be the capability
to whom a successful result should be delivered.
The _fail_ customer will be the capability
to whom a failure notification may be send.
This transforms exception handling into simple message-flow.

### Evaluation

A critical capability for general computation
is _evaluation_ in the context of an _environment_.
Evaluation produces a _value_,
but cannot cause any _effects_.
The protocol for evaluation involves
sending a request and receiving a response.
The request looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | ok |
| 0x08 | fail |
| 0x0c | environment |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

If the request is "successful",
a response is sent to `ok`
that looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | ok |
| 0x04 | result |
| 0x08 | -- |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

If the request is "unsuccessful",
the original event is immediately delivered to `fail`
_without going through the event queue_.
Note that this means the `target`
will **not** be the `fail` actor.

#### b_literal

The _evaluation_ capability for a _literal_
always responds with the identity of the target.

#### b_constant

The _evaluation_ capability for a _constant_
responds with a consistent _value_
regardless of the _environment_ in which it is evaluated.

#### b_load / b_store

A primitive mutable value supports two capabilities,
_load_ and _store_.
The _load_ capability retrieves the currently stored value,
and responds with that value.
The _store_ capability replaces the stored value,
and responds with the value stored.
The protocol for _store_ is not _evaluation_,
but is very similar.
Instead of receiving an _environment_,
there is a generic _parameter_
(the new value to store, in this case).

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | ok |
| 0x08 | fail |
| 0x0c | parameter |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

#### a_undefined / b_arrow

A primitive generalization of partial functions
can be expressed with `a_undefined` and `b_arrow`.
The protocol is the same as `b_store`,
taking a _parameter_ and returning a _result_.

The actor `a_undefined` is the base/failure case.
It immediately calls `fail`.
It can be used to terminate a search-chain,
or provide a default.

The `b_arrow` behavior demonstrates an explicit finite-mapping,
with each actor instance providing a _result_
for a particular _parameter_ value.
The resulting structure
is a linear-search dictionary
of "name/value" pairs
terminated by `a_undefined`.

Note that a variety of alternative implementations are possible,
consistent with the same _parameter_/_result_-or-fail protocol.
Functional algorithms, including recursion, can be easily supported.

### Streams

Streams are a primitive abstraction of seqential access patterns.
A _read_ capability consumes an element from the stream.
A _write_ capability produces an element to the stream.

A _read_ request looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | ok |
| 0x08 | fail |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

If the request is "successful",
a response is sent to `ok`
that looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | ok |
| 0x04 | element |
| 0x08 | next |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

The `next` field in a _read_ response
is the _read_ capability for subsequent requests.
Each _read_ capability can be thought of
as a "cursor position" in the stream.

A _write_ request looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | target |
| 0x04 | ok |
| 0x08 | fail |
| 0x0c | element |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

If the request is "successful",
a response is sent to `ok`
that looks like this:

| Offset | Event Field |
|--------|-------|
| 0x00 | ok |
| 0x04 | next |
| 0x08 | -- |
| 0x0c | -- |
| 0x10 | -- |
| 0x14 | -- |
| 0x18 | -- |
| 0x1c | -- |

The `next` field in a _write_ response
is the _write_ capability for subsequent requests.
Each _write_ capability can be thought of
as a "cursor position" in the stream.

#### a_end

The actor `a_end` immediately calls `fail`.
As a _read_ capability it represents the base/empty case.
As a _write_ capability it represents the final/full case.
The call to `fail` can often be avoided
by comparing your _read_/_write_ capability
(such as the value of `next`)
to `a_end` before using it.
